# API reference (JSON-RPC)

### Controlling Tyzen Core

Run _tyzend_ or _tyzen-qt -server_. You can control it via the command-line _tyzen_-cli utility or by [HTTP JSON-RPC](http://json-rpc.org/wiki/specification) commands.

You must create a _tyzen_.conf configuration file setting an rpcuser and rpcpassword; see [Tyzen.conf ](tyzen.conf.md)for details.

Now run:

```
 $ ./tyzend -daemon
 tyzen server starting
 $ ./tyzen-cli -rpcwait help
 # shows the help text
```

A [list of RPC calls](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original\_Bitcoin\_client/API\_Calls\_list) will be shown.

```
 $ ./tyzen-cli getbalance
 2000.00000
```

### JSON-RPC

Running Tyzen with the -server argument (or running _tyzen_d) tells it to function as a [HTTP JSON-RPC](http://json-rpc.org/wiki/specification) server, but [Basic access authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic\_access\_authentication) must be used when communicating with it, and, for security, by default, the server only accepts connections from other processes on the same machine. If your HTTP or JSON library requires you to specify which 'realm' is authenticated, use 'jsonrpc'.

Allowing arbitrary machines to access the JSON-RPC port (using the rpcallowip [configuration option](json-rpc-interface.md)) is dangerous and **strongly discouraged**-- access should be strictly limited to trusted machines.

To access the server you should find a [suitable library](http://json-rpc.org/wiki/implementations) for your language.
